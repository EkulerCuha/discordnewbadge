<h3>Easiest way to get Discord's new badge Active Developer</h3>

> A MESSAGE FROM EKULERCUHA


As you all know, Discord published a new article on November 22. In this article, if you have used a command containing a slash command from an application you have owned for the last 1 month, it gives you a new badge called Active Developer. And in this article, I will explain how to get this badge easily for those who want to get this badge and those who don't have experience developing an app before.




<h2>What do you need to do if you do not have an application that you have created before?</h2>

<p>You need to create a new application from the <a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications"><b>Discord Developer Portal</b></a>.</p>

After performing this operation, copy your token from the Bot tab of the application.


<p>After this step, all you have to do is paste your token into the part that says <b>YOUR_APPS_TOKEN</b> in the <b>config.json</b>.</p>


Finally, after running the run.bat file, you will need to run the command named /badge on a server where your bot is attached.
